          <h1> <font color="red" size="7"> 5 Most <i><b>memorable</b></i> <strong>Arsenal FC </strong>wins</h1> </font> <br>  
            
         <header> <p><font size="6"> Arsenal have played some memorable matches in their 128-year history.

                  Whether in Europe, the English top flight, one of the cups or merely against archrivals Tottenham Hotspur in any competition, the Gunners have provided plenty of entertainment—and one or two last-gasp results—for their loyal supporters.
                  
                  The following slideshow will highlight 20 of the greatest matches Arsenal have ever contested.
                  
                  They’ve yielded trophies, major final appearances and, naturally, victories at home and away to Spurs.
                  
                  Let’s get to it.</font></p><br></header>

                  <p><font size="4">Arsenal had been bounced out of the FA Cup by Tottenham Hotspur as recently as 1991, so when the 1993 semi-final was held at Wembley for the first time, they were desperate to enact revenge on their local rivals.

                        They didn’t disappoint.<br>
                        
                        With just 10 minutes remaining and both sides yet to find the back of the net, Tony Adams got on the end of Paul Merson’s free kick and headed what proved to be the winner past goalkeeper Erik Thorstvedt.</font></p>

                 <p><font size="4">In 2002, the FA Cup final was played before the end of the Premier League season. It was also staged at Cardiff’s Millennium Stadium, as the new Wembley was still under construction.

                  With 20 minutes remaining, Ray Parlour opened the scoring against opponents Chelsea, and exactly 10 minutes later, Freddie Ljungberg put the finishing touches on a 2-0 win that would set up a historic double.

                        But thanks to Thierry Henry’s heroics, they became the first-ever English side to win at the Bernabeu and progressed to the next round after a scoreless draw at Highbury.</font></p>

                        <p><font size="4">Arsenal had already won the FA Cup when they traveled to Old Trafford in search of a historic double.

                              Unbeaten away from home in 2001-02, the Gunners scored the only goal of their showdown with Manchester United when Sylvain Wiltord turned Freddie Ljunberg’s rebound past Fabien Barthez.
                              
                              Incredibly, Arsenel had won the match despite the absences of Tony Adams, Robert Pires, Dennis Bergkamp and Thierry Henry.</font></p><br>

                        <p><font size="4">Eighteen years had passed since Arsenal’s title win in 1971 when they next had a chance to finish atop the old First Division.

                              But coming into the final day of the 1988-89 season, the Gunners needed to score two more clear goals than title rivals Liverpool, and their last mach just happened to come against the Reds—at Anfield.
                              
                              Shortly after the restart, with both sides having yet to score, Alan Smith beat Bruce Grobbelaar to put the guests in front. And then, late on, a delightful move that involved John Lukic, Lee Dixon, Smith and Michael Thomas resulted in the latter notching the title-winning goal.
